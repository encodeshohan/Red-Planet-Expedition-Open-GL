# Red-Planet-Expedition-Open-GL


## Story Description
<p>The title of this project is <b>Red Planet Expedition</b>. In this project features a dynamic scene set against the backdrop of a sea, incorporating various interactive elements and structures. Central to the scene is a patrol boat that moves from left to right across the water. The boat's movement can be controlled using specific keys: pressing "b" pauses the boat, while pressing "c" resumes its motion. On either side of the scene, there are two buildings, each accompanied by a pair of trees. The right-side building is notable for its rooftop antenna, which rotates continuously. To protect these structures from the sea, a sea dam is included in the environment.</p>

<p>Adding to the aerial dynamics, a drone equipped with two rotating propellers flies from left to right in the sky. Between the two buildings stands a platform that supports a rocket, which is divided into three sections: the left rocket, middle rocket, right rocket, and the main rocket. Flanking the rocket on the platform are two stands. The rocket launch sequence is initiated by pressing the "a" key, causing the stands to move in opposite directions to the end of the platform and the rocket to ascend vertically through the red planet. After a brief ascent, the rocket reaches the second frame.
In the second frame, the rocket continues traveling upward. After a while, it reaches the third frame, where the left rocket, middle rocket, and right rocket separate and move downwards while the main rocket continues its ascent. As the main rocket travels further, it transitions into the fourth frame. Here, the main rocket rotates from a vertical to a horizontal orientation, with a background filled with moving stars. Pressing the "m" key advances the scene to the fifth frame.</p>

<p>In the fifth frame, the main rocket descends vertically and lands on the surface of a red planet. This planet features two large mountains, one on the left side and another on the right, with a distant backdrop of additional mountains. The ground of the red planet is dotted with two bulks, one on the left and one on the right, while a moon planet rotates in the sky. Pressing the "n" key transitions the scene to the sixth frame.</p>

<p>The sixth frame is similar to the fifth, but instead of the right mountain, there is a base camp, and the ground is devoid of bulks. Additionally, a rover with three wheels is seen rotating from left to right.</p>
